To\nthis end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the\nnonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mu\n}\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\mu})=\\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is\nconsidered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved.

        "Timing evidence in determining the accretion state of the Seyfert galaxy\n  NGC 3783   Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have\nsuggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope\nnear zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black\nhole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does\nhave a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN\nand GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an\nimproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on\nconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of\ncontinuous observation by XMM-Newton.

Thus NGC 3783 is not\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found\nin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other\nAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.\n",

The steerable\nwavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to\ndefine three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,\norientation and elongation of local features.

        "Are constant loop widths an artifact of the background and the spatial\n  resolution?   We study the effect of the coronal background in the determination of the\ndiameter of EUV loops, and we analyze the suitability of the procedure followed\nin a previous paper (L\\'opez Fuentes, Klimchuk & D\\'emoulin 2006) for\ncharacterizing their expansion properties. For the analysis we create different\nsynthetic loops and we place them on real backgrounds from data obtained with\nthe Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\\textit{TRACE}). We apply to these\nloops the same procedure followed in our previous works, and we compare the\nresults with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allows\nus to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with\nheight, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for\nloops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops\nare below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that\nsmall-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to\nimperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in\nespecially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright\nrelative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the\nability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do\nnot expand systematically with height is robust.\n",

        "A practical Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone jet algorithm   Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event\nparticles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\n'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\nhadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless\nalgorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through\nreduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some\nmulti-jet observables.\n",

Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray\nemission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a\npower law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the\nX-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than\nthe radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly\noffset from each other.

The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7\nmm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.\nThe dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200\nAU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU.

        "Dynamical Casimir effect for gravitons in bouncing braneworlds   We consider a two-brane system in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter\nspacetime. We study particle creation due to the motion of the physical brane\nwhich first approaches the second static brane (contraction) and then recedes\nfrom it(expansion). The spectrum and the energy density of the generated\ngravitons are calculated. We show that the massless gravitons have a blue\nspectrum and that their energy density satisfies the nucleosynthesis bound with\nvery mild constraints on the parameters. We also show that the Kaluza-Klein\nmodes cannot provide the dark matter in an anti-de-Sitter braneworld. However,\nfor natural choices of parameters, backreaction from the Kaluza-Klein gravitons\nmay well become important. The main findings of this work have been published\nin the form of a Letter [R.

        "Opportunistic Relay Selection with Limited Feedback   It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on\nopportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in\ndense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ\ntransmission approach where relays forward parity information to the\ndestination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,\nsuffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the\nbest channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by\nadding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection\nproblem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is\nnecessary for good throughput performance.

According to this property the\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\ncan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.\n",

        "Extended solar emission - an analysis of the EGRET data   The Sun was recently predicted to be an extended source of gamma-ray\nemission, produced by inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic-ray electrons with\nthe solar radiation. The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse\nextragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While\nthis emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the\nsituation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed\nstudy of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for\nthe effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which\ninterfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon\nsignal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for\nemission from the Sun and its vicinity.

Using the AutoCorrelation Function\nand Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the\nmechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the\natomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We\nalso investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,\nusing also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime\ncould superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,\nusing the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing\nmass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most\ninteresting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis\n(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of\nself-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating\nvalues indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of\nincreasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are\nidentified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.\nIn particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear\nmethods is further required.\n",

        "Remnant evolution after a carbon-oxygen white dwarf merger   We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen\n(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\ndwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\ncharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\nexplosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).\n",

Archival INTEGRAL data\nand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of\n~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic\noutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of\nOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source\nbehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The\nsource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th\nFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,\nduring a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure\nof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a\nSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed\npower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak\nluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of\nthe optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an\noutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,\nand they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost\nquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously\nthought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the\nbrightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly\nincreasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit\nwith many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous\naccretion.\n",

        "Lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible\n  Navier-Stokes equations   In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted\nto the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain\nunchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a\ndiscrete kinetic theory which yields \\textit{exactly} the fluid equations,\ni.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \\textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).\nThe purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse\nkinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this\nproblem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important\nrequirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that\nit yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but\nsuitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the\nboundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem\ncan be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial\ndistribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic\napproximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations\n\\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates\nof customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial\ncompressibility method are discussed.\n",

        "On the Origin of the Dichotomy of Early-Type Galaxies: The Role of Dry\n  Mergers and AGN Feedback   Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large\nN-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type\ngalaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\n\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\nmerger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central\ncusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.\n",

        "Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of 3C 66A\n  during the WEBT campaign of 2003 -- 2004   The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength\nmonitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with\nflux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very\nhigh energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet\nmodel to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our\nmultiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce\nthe observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value\nfor the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due\nto the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the\nhigh-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence\nof a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role\nin the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to\nthe central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and\ngamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton\nemission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral\nvariability pattern.

Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths.

Commutation\n  relations for free fields   Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory\nof free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical\nview-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg\nequations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for\nuniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some\nclass of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their\ngeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity\nof all Heisenberg equations.

That implies\ncorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction\nof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation\nrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables\nis reduced to normal ordering.

Distance\nmeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk\nobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo\ndark matter residing in such objects.\n  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white\ndwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al.

We show that the\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\n",

        "Composite fermion wave functions as conformal field theory correlators   It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been\nexpressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin\nwave function at filling factor $\\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the\nPfaffian wave function at $\\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and\nquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and\nstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that\ndescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general\nclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and\n$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a\ngeneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other\nfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling\nfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.\n",

We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that\ndespite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.\nAlthough sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very\nlarge, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy\nlifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the\ndegeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality\nHamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition\non increasing $J'/J$, from $\\sqrt 3\\times \\sqrt 3$ type order to a new\nferrimagnetic {\\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is\nconfirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice.

We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite.

        "Constraints on the Self-Interaction Cross-Section of Dark Matter from\n  Numerical Simulations of the Merging Galaxy Cluster 1E 0657-5   (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak\nlensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging\ngalaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.\n",

        "Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows\n  over a gradual slope with bottom friction   This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear\nperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n",

        "Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps   The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not\nnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\nimportant.

Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\nwith the deRham cohomology groups.

But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function\ngenerating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real\nrefinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different\n2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\cL}^2(\\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar\nMRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential\noperators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be\nintensively used for applications.\n",

We show that, for lines\nthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line\ncritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming\nmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity.

Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star\nmodels are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive\nhelium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during\ncore-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few\nmillennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent\nevolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence\ncompanions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars\nin close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the\nstrong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain\nsufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.\n",

        "Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed\n  Consensus   In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject\nto:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since\nsensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,\nor communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\n",

This is done by\ncombining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on\nfull simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM\nHiggs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios\nin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We\nstudy the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta\nplane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters.

While the variation of $\\mu$ can shift the\nprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by\nabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable\nwith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the\ndiscovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy\nneutral Higgs bosons can be determined.

        "Magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks   Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of\nprotoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular\nmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of\noutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications\nfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak\nionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able\nto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation\nequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk\nmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling\nby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the\nconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have\ngrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields\ncan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are\ngenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while\nelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the\nmagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.\n  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have\na combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated\nto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,\nx-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150\ng/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have\naggregated to 1 micron in size.\n",

        "Nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks   Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are\ninvestigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state.\n",

        "Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in\n  magnetized weakly collisional plasmas   We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

We believe this\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n",

In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\n+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\n",

        "Cosmogenic neutrinos as a probe of the transition from Galactic to\n  extragalactic cosmic rays   There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\it\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\it proton-dip\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\n",

        "X-ray Timing Observations of PSR J1930+1852 in the Crab-like SNR\n  G54.1+0.3   We present new X-ray timing and spectral observations of PSR J1930+1852, the\nyoung energetic pulsar at the center of the non-thermal supernova remnant\nG54.1+0.3. Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra\nX-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms\npulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution\nshows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of\n$\\dot P = 7.5112(6) \\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise\nand/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\\pm5%$\nmodulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\\sim 70%$\nduty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed\nemission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\\Gamma =\n1.2\\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The\ntotal 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.\n",

We find a size-dependent cumulative\nadvantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.\nIn previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research\ngroups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property\nof the science system.

Yet,\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.\n",

        "A binary model for the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies (MNRAS version)   The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of\nelliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that\nthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars\nwithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin\nhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as\nhad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly\ndependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from\ndwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.\n",

Quantified species included carbon monoxide and\ndioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,\nallene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,\n1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a\nPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from\n700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,\nsome improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our\nlaboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons.

        "Detecting and Characterizing Planetary Systems with Transit Timing   In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance two\ngoals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to\nthe Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a\nnew planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards\nboth of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is\nable to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet\ntransits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time\nbetween transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer\nthe orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass\nthat is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique\ncomplements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion\nresonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced\nsensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the\nphotometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV\nplanet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of\nhigh-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing\ntelescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting\nplanets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.\nA relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\\sim 0.5\n{\\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically\nincrease the effectiveness of transit timing observations.\n",

        "The Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in Massive Elliptical\n  Galaxies: Globular Cluster Multimodality from Radial Variation of Stellar\n  Populations   The most massive elliptical galaxies show a prominent multi-modality in their\nglobular cluster system color distributions. Understanding the mechanisms which\nlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete\npicture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster\nformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial\nvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &\nMatteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the\ndistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric\nradius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular\nclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the\nobserved multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can\nbe, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar\npopulations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population\nof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very\ngood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity\ndistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of\nmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity\ntransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model\n(abridged)\n",

        "The Boundary Conditions of the Heliosphere: Photoionization Models\n  Constrained by Interstellar and In Situ Data   The boundary conditions of the heliosphere are set by the ionization, density\nand composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the properties\nof the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiative\ntransfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation\nfield using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray\nbackground. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and\nthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating\nbecause of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible\nrange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to\nradiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data\nfrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the\nheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to\nconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column\ndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the\nobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)\nand T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron\ndensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-\n0.01 cm^-3.

We incorporate a new method for including the\nradiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,\nled to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to\nthe low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with\ncosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with\nmetallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The\nsimulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5\nMsolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core\nreveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4\nZsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with\nmetallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share\nmost of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass\nproto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=\n10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower\nlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass.

The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results.

As an illustration of our\nproposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the\ngenerating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity\namplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.\n",

        "Shaping the Globular Cluster Mass Function by Stellar-Dynamical\n  Evaporation   We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way\ndepends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover\nmass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\n(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not\ndepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the\nglobular cluster system.\n",

We solve numerically\nthe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the\nspin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode\namplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway\n(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are\nshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary\nproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature\nT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA\nreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to\nranges of these parameters.

In\nparticular, we study the mapping of this solution to the parameterized\npost-Newtonian formalism to 1 PN order in the metric.

We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover\nreliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.

We present a general master equation governing\nthe dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of the\nDebye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward and\ndownward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are\nperformed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of\nbound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate\nis shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep\nbound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.\nMoreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of\nmagnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.\nWe also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for\nthermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\\mu$K to 400\n$\\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the\nadsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the\nheating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free\ndownward decay) rate is negligible.\n",

        "Type D Einstein spacetimes in higher dimensions   We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G,\nI_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional\nconditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The\nconclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing\nhorizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\nthe types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the\nsimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,\npossibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that\nthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''\ntype D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are\ngeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,\nhowever, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit\nnon-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in\nany n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D\nWeyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \\Phi_{ij}. In the case with\n``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''\ncase \\Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \\Phi_{ij} coincide with those\nof the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike\ndirections of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing\nthe twistfree condition and assuming instead that \\Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The\nn=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are\nbriefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.\n",

We have detected the red giant branch bump\nfor the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected\nrelative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence\nturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the\nYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina\nmodels. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to\nmain-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity.

NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,\nconsistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue\nstraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or\nRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at\nlarge distances from the center.

Our observations include 1.3mm continuum and\nspectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cm\nwater maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nThe cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is\nclearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm\ncontinuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are\ndominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for\nthese cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core\n(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region\nand exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region.

We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further\nmultiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O\nmaser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust\ncores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The\ndominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces\nthe surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material\non its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the\nnortheast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely\ntraces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1.

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.\n",

We base our\nwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided\nhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably\nmodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\npre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\nrate, among a number of important factors.

In estimating the probability, we\nconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as\nthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the\nphotometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from\nprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of the\nmagnification.

Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,\nknown as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a\nsource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as\nscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data\nfor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are\npresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this\ncompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV\nthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the\nvariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the\nflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and\n10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m\nUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the\nvariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of\nthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic\nannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is\nin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting\na simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency\ndependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the\nscattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size.

The study and\nclassification of pairs $(M,\\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In\nthis setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\cite{Reeb} states that a manifold\nadmitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.\nIn particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function.

In\nthe present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To\ndo this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities\nand the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an\nelimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle\nconfigurations (of consecutive indices).

Finally, the existence of\na closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type\nresult.\n",

        "Galactic Wind Signatures around High Redshift Galaxies   We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths\nof supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming\ngalaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)\nabsorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.\n",

Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42\nclass II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I\nprotostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after\naccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members.

The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\nabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find\nthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that\nrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,\nstarless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population\nindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars.

We conclude that the foreground quasars\nshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\nthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\nThus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\noverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\nFurthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\ntransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\nspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of\nQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.\n",

        "The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: The local supermassive black hole mass\n  function in early- and late-type galaxies   We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function\nusing (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and the\nSersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured\n(spheroid) Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy\nCatalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct\nmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for\nboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it\nstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type\ngalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function\nwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope\n(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy\nsample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and\nintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local\nmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,\nearly-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type\ngalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The\nuncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include\nuncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the\ngalaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive\nblack hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.\nThat is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)\nh^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in\nsupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.\n",

Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest.

        "Broadening the Higgs Boson with Right-Handed Neutrinos and a Higher\n  Dimension Operator at the Electroweak Scale   The existence of certain TeV suppressed higher-dimension operators may open\nup new decay channels for the Higgs boson to decay into lighter right-handed\nneutrinos. These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs\nboson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are\nsubdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic\ndecay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks.\nA distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced\nvertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed\nusing the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel\ndecay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental\nconstraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question\nof whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the\napproximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.\n",

A m sin i = 11\n  Mearth planet around the nearby spotted M dwarf GJ 674   Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of\nplanetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\nadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\nreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\nthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that\nthe host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary\nsystem.\n",

        "Behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli: A neurodynamical model   In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a\nbehavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a\ndirected multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.\nIt has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is\nmanifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that\ncircuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients\nof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\nbe impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible\nexplanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain\nhas been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential\nbehavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance\nto hemodynamics has been outlined.\n",

Such a dynamical evolution process is included\nhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and\nLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs\nvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet\nccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy.

Unlike graphite the charge carriers show Dirac particle\nproperties (i.e. an anomalous Berry's phase, weak anti-localization and square\nroot field dependence of the Landau level energies). Epitaxial graphene shows\nquasi-ballistic transport and long coherence lengths; properties which may\npersists above cryogenic temperatures. Paradoxically, in contrast to exfoliated\ngraphene, the quantum Hall effect is not observed in high mobility epitaxial\ngraphene. It appears that the effect is suppressed due to absence of localized\nstates in the bulk of the material.Epitaxial graphene can be patterned using\nstandard lithography methods and characterized using a wide array of\ntechniques. These favorable features indicate that interconnected room\ntemperature ballistic devices may be feasible for low dissipation high-speed\nnanoelectronics.\n",

        "Two new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt?   The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the\ndescription of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the\ndiversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be\nidentified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type\nin the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic\nobservations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)\n1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have\nbeen previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been\nobtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in\nNovember and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep\nslope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of\n0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence\nof a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some\nquestions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has\nnever been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected\nit. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused\nby the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,\ntogether with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16\nmay be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main\nBelt.\n",
