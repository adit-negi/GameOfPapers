        "J/psi Production in an Equilibrating Partonic System   Any color singlet or octet ccbar pair is created at short distances and then\nexpands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included\nhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and\nLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs\nvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet\nccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the\nsuppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a\nbulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and\nthe ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an\nindicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the\nrapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be\n-3<y<3.\n",

        "In-medium effects on particle production in heavy ion collisions   The effect of possible in-medium modifications of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$)\ncross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions\n($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\it\ninelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+})$- and\n$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\ninelastic cross sections.

The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios\nin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A.

While the variation of $\\mu$ can shift the\nprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by\nabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable\nwith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters.

These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs\nboson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are\nsubdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic\ndecay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks.\nA distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced\nvertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed\nusing the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel\ndecay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental\nconstraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question\nof whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the\napproximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.\n",

        "A practical Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone jet algorithm   Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event\nparticles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\n'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\nhadron levels.

The\nradial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1\nM_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbital\nfit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a\nlong-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentric\norbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.\nThe shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal\ntemporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. We\nfind clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profile\nvariations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.\n",

        "Reexamination of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from\n  equation-of-motion approach   The longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, in\nsemiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approach\nfor different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Various\nmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon\ninteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due\nto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the\nelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine\ninteraction are included. The relative contributions from these spin\ndecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the\nspin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked\neffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin\ndephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,\nthough the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.\n",

Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM.

Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources.

        "Optimal stimulus and noise distributions for information transmission\n  via suprathreshold stochastic resonance   Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal\ntransmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical\nthreshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of\nstochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input\nsignals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small\namounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR\nin the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between\nShannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for\noptimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is\nachieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the\nnoise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal\ndistribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical\nverification and justification for previous work in both computational\nneuroscience and electronics.\n",

        "Dust Formation and Survival in Supernova Ejecta   The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of\ngrains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.\n",

        "Lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible\n  Navier-Stokes equations   In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted\nto the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain\nunchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a\ndiscrete kinetic theory which yields \\textit{exactly} the fluid equations,\ni.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \\textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).\nThe purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse\nkinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this\nproblem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important\nrequirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that\nit yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but\nsuitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the\nboundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem\ncan be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial\ndistribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic\napproximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations\n\\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates\nof customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial\ncompressibility method are discussed.\n",

We extend the analysis of James Lynch who was\nable to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random\nnetworks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in\nthe disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only\nfor networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the\nBoolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary\nconnectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns\nout that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\\lambda$ is equivalent to the\nexpectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct\nthe network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the\naverage sensitivity.

As such, the achievable dynamic range with our\nalgorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of\nmagnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where\nthe dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding\nand HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with\nradiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size\ndistributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps.

        "Cosmogenic neutrinos as a probe of the transition from Galactic to\n  extragalactic cosmic rays   There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\it\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\it proton-dip\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\n",

For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of\nthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable.

In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\naccretion that varies with the binary period.

        "The Determination of the Helicity of $W'$ Boson Couplings at the LHC   Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new charged\ngauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Such\nparticles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In\nthis paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling\nhelicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery\nchannel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution,\nreconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides\nthe best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires\nintegrated luminosities of $\\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV\nand provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This\nhelicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various\ndiscovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference\nregime, but with higher integrated luminosities.\n",

The simultaneous optical state,\nmonitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is\ncomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst.

We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that\ndespite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.\nAlthough sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very\nlarge, growing exponentially with the system perimeter.

Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern.

The high spatial resolution of the MSX\nobservations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the\nsky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches\nwell the orientation expected from the proper motion.

The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed\n[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density\nlimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and\nignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have\nlower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line\nflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that\ndifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in\nthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit\nand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the\ntorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of\nextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line\nratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities\nassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We\nalso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended\nand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from\nlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from\nsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby\ngalaxies.\n",

Archival INTEGRAL data\nand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of\n~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic\noutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of\nOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source\nbehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The\nsource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th\nFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,\nduring a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure\nof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a\nSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed\npower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak\nluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of\nthe optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an\noutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,\nand they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost\nquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously\nthought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the\nbrightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly\nincreasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit\nwith many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous\naccretion.\n",

These\neffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying\ntopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is\ndescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n",

        "Isospin breaking in the yield of heavy meson pairs in e+e- annihilation\n  near threshold   We revisit the problem of interplay between the strong and the Coulomb\ninteraction in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio for $B {\\bar B}$ and $D {\\bar\nD}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. We\nconsider here a realistic situation with a resonant interaction in the isospin\nI=0 channel and a nonresonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state. We\nfind that the yield ratio has a smooth behavior depending on the scattering\nphase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\\bar\nK}$ production at the $\\phi(1020)$ resonance, where the Coulomb effect in the\ncharged-to-neutral yield ratio is generally sensitive to the scattering phases\nin both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply the\nsame approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass difference\nbetween the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scattering\neffects generally result in a modification to the pure kinematical effect of\nthis mass difference.\n",

The\ncarrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessence\nfield slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model is\na second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold\ndark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of the\nquintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).\nHowever, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this\nmanner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical\nstudy reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold\ndark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter\nenergy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of\nsupersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure\nconstant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)\n``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)\nthe long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a\nRobertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3).

We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the\n0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for\nfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high\nGalactic latitudes).

        "AMR simulations of the low T/|W| bar-mode instability of neutron stars   It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a\nhigh degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode\ndeformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to\ngravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications\nfor gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core\ncollapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,\nperformed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low\nT/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the\nnonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which\nshow that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the\ncorotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode\ndeformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are\nconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an\nimportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,\nwhich has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable\namplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.\n",

This analysis did not require the\nmodification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five\ndimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,\nwhich plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,\nand suggested a value for ar.

In estimating the probability, we\nconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as\nthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the\nphotometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from\nprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of the\nmagnification.

We base our\nwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided\nhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably\nmodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering).

        "A Universality in PP-Waves   We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\nspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed.

The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results.

In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n",

        "Composite fermion wave functions as conformal field theory correlators   It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been\nexpressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin\nwave function at filling factor $\\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the\nPfaffian wave function at $\\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and\nquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and\nstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that\ndescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general\nclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and\n$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a\ngeneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other\nfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling\nfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.\n",

The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is\ninvoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the\ntransfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore\nthe thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation\nfunctions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for\nthe three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks\nat wavevectors $q=a\\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero\nmagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization\nplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\\pi /3$ and\n$4\\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent.

We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically.

        "The Boundary Conditions of the Heliosphere: Photoionization Models\n  Constrained by Interstellar and In Situ Data   The boundary conditions of the heliosphere are set by the ionization, density\nand composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the properties\nof the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiative\ntransfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation\nfield using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray\nbackground. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and\nthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating\nbecause of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible\nrange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to\nradiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data\nfrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the\nheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to\nconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column\ndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the\nobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)\nand T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron\ndensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-\n0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with\nsub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however\nC is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, and\npartially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, and\nX(He^+) ~ 0.4. These results appear to be robust since acceptable models are\nfound for substantially different input radiation fields. Our results favor low\nvalues for the reference solar abundances for the LIC composition.\n",

        "Behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli: A neurodynamical model   In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a\nbehavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a\ndirected multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.\nIt has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is\nmanifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that\ncircuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients\nof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\nbe impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible\nexplanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain\nhas been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential\nbehavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance\nto hemodynamics has been outlined.\n",

        "Galactic Wind Signatures around High Redshift Galaxies   We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths\nof supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming\ngalaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)\nabsorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.\n",

In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\nnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging\nnon-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original\nproblem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the\ntransformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates\nLagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method\nbased on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient\nmethod.

        "On the Origin of the Dichotomy of Early-Type Galaxies: The Role of Dry\n  Mergers and AGN Feedback   Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large\nN-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type\ngalaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\n\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\nmerger.

Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\nthe types D or O.

        "Circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr\n  spacetimes   We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a\nnearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.\n",

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.\n",

        "Does the Blazar Gamma-Ray Spectrum Harden with Increasing Flux? Analysis\n  of 9 Years of EGRET Data   The Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on the Compton Gamma-Ray\nObservatory (CGRO) discovered gamma-ray emission from more than 67 blazars\nduring its 9 yr lifetime. We conducted an exhaustive search of the EGRET\narchives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times and\nwere bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law\nmodels. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6\nlow-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac\nobjects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral\nindex with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for\nspectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.\nThere is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in\nfive blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS\n1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral\ndependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We\nobserved a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in\nall three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were\navailable. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the\nwidely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior in\nthe context of various inverse Compton mechanisms believed to be responsible\nfor emission in the EGRET energy range. Our analysis uses the EGRET skymaps\nthat were regenerated to include the changes in performance during the mission.\n",

After an appropriate transformation of the\nscale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant\nmass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\\Lambda$\ncold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds\nto a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into\naccount the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized\nstraightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology.\n",

It has\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\n",

In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as\nhad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly\ndependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from\ndwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.\n",

        "Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG): A Model of Self Organizing Network from\n  Input Categorization   Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks\nhave strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into\naccount a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is\nconditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the\nstructural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen\nin a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise\naffected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility\nof emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to\ndifferent inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas\n(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending\non the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is\nconsidered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local\nand global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly\nadapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis\nshows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply\nphysical sense- the term gas here used.\n",

        "Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps   The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not\nnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\nwith the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the\nsmooth and holomorphic setting.\n",

        "Domain wall switching: optimizing the energy landscape   It has recently been suggested that exchange spring media offer a way to\nincrease media density without causing thermal instability\n(superparamagnetism), by using a hard and a soft layer coupled by exchange.\nVictora has suggested a figure of merit xi = 2 E_b/mu_0 m_s H_sw, the ratio of\nthe energy barrier to that of a Stoner-Wohlfarth system with the same switching\nfield, which is 1 for a Stoner-Wohlfarth (coherently switching) particle and 2\nfor an optimal two-layer composite medium. A number of theoretical approaches\nhave been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled\nStoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show\nthat many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or\napproximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy\nis minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in\nterms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which\nboth the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability\n(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this\nformulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which can\nbe no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suess\net al comes very close to this limit.\n",

        "Two new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt?   The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the\ndescription of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the\ndiversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be\nidentified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type\nin the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic\nobservations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)\n1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have\nbeen previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been\nobtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in\nNovember and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep\nslope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of\n0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence\nof a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some\nquestions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has\nnever been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected\nit. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused\nby the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,\ntogether with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16\nmay be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main\nBelt.\n",

        "Quantifying social group evolution   The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in\ncomplex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,\nfamilies, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent\nchanges in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the\nassociated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.\nOur knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is\nlimited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and\nself-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm\nbased on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate\nthe time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to\nuncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on\nnetworks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between\nmobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are\ncapable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to\nchange the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small\ngroups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that\ntheir composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the\ntime commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating\nthe community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental\ndifferences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.\n",

        "A Rigorous Time-Domain Analysis of Full--Wave Electromagnetic Cloaking\n  (Invisibility)   There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical\npossibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.\nThe basic idea of these invisibility devices \\cite{glu1, glu2, le},\\cite{pss1}\nis to use anisotropic {\\it transformation media} whose permittivity and\npermeability $\\var^{\\lambda\\nu}, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,\n$\\var_0^{\\lambda\\nu}, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular\ntransformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking\nin the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.\nThis formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical\nproblems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the\npermeability of the {\\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked\nobjects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\\\"odinger form with the\nelectromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that\nthe electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially\nself-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily\nequivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium\n$\\var_0^{\\lambda\\nu}, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the\ncoordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the\nscattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the\nconstruction of \\cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \\cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and\nactive devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove\ncloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove\nthat it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.\n",

        "The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: The local supermassive black hole mass\n  function in early- and late-type galaxies   We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function\nusing (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and the\nSersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured\n(spheroid) Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy\nCatalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct\nmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for\nboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it\nstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type\ngalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function\nwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope\n(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy\nsample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and\nintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local\nmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,\nearly-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type\ngalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The\nuncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include\nuncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the\ngalaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive\nblack hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.\nThat is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)\nh^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in\nsupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.\n",

        "Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding\n  Matrix   Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the\nreceiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively\nactivates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\n",

        "A Spitzer census of the IC 348 nebula   We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star\ncluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42\nclass II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I\nprotostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after\naccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census\nof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially\nwith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around\na B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\nabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find\nthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that\nrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,\nstarless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population\nindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that\nthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its\nsmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While\nit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of\ndynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings\nsupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller\nsub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the\nsupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should\nnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.\n",

        "Spin Evolution of Accreting Neutron Stars: Nonlinear Development of the\n  R-mode Instability   The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the\nspin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet\nof modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically\nthe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the\nspin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode\namplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway\n(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are\nshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary\nproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature\nT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA\nreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to\nranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude\nremains small $\\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer\nviscosity to $\\nu_{max} \\sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.\nWe find that for $\\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for\nabout 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the\nlocal group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.\n",
