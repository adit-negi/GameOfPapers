ABSTRACT


Fashion Compatibility Modeling (FCM) is a new yet challenging
task, which aims to automatically access the matching degree
among a set of complementary items. Most of existing methods
evaluate the fashion compatibility from the common perspective,
but overlook the user’s personal preference. Inspired by this, a few
pioneers study the Personalized Fashion Compatibility Modeling
(PFCM). Despite their significance, these PFCM methods mainly
concentrate on the user and item entities, as well as their interac-
tions, but ignore the attribute entities, which contain rich semantics.
To address this problem, we propose to fully explore the related
entities and their relations involved in PFCM to boost the PFCM
performance. This is, however, non-trivial due to the heteroge-
neous contents of different entities, embeddings for new users, and
various high-order relations. Towards these ends, we present a
novel metapath-guided personalized fashion compatibility mod-
eling, dubbed as MG-PFCM. In particular, we creatively build a
heterogeneous graph to unify the three types of entities (i.e., users,
items, and attributes) and their relations (i.e., user-item interac-
tions, item-item matching relations, and item-attribute association
relations). Thereafter, we design a multi-modal content-oriented
user embedding module to learn user representations by inherit-
ing the contents of their interacted items. Meanwhile, we define
the user-oriented and item-oriented metapaths, and perform the
metapath-guided heterogeneous graph learning to enhance the user
and item embeddings. In addition, we introduce the contrastive
regularization to improve the model performance. We conduct ex-
tensive experiments on the real-world benchmark dataset, which
verifies the superiority of our proposed scheme over several cutting-
edge baselines. As a byproduct, we have released our source codes
to benefit other researchers.

INTRODUCTION


Given a set of fashion items, Fashion Compatibility Modeling [21],
FCM for short, is to estimate their matching degree towards a
proper outfit. Due to its significance and value in E-commerce like
fashion item recommendation [17], FCM has gained increasing at-
tention from both academic and industrial communities. Although
great success has been achieved by existing efforts [7, 13, 32], they
mainly focus on the general fashion compatibility modeling, that
is, exploring the compatibility among fashion items from the com-
mon perspective while overlooking users’ personal preferences. In
practice, this is not applicable to the real-world fashion product
recommendation scenarios.
